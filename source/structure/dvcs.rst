**TL;DNR** The Densho Digital Repository is basically a huge collection of binary digital media files with metadata encoded in standard data formats in plaintext files.  The editors application is built on top of industry-standard software that preserves the editing history of each file and can make identical copies of the entire Repository and keep them in sync with each other.
